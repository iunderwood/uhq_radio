<h5>1.00 Alpha 1   [WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT RELEASED]</h5>  Dev: XOOPS 2.5.11, PHP 7.4.22, PHP 8.0.9
<hr>
- namespaces (mamba)

- PHP7, PHP8 adjustments (mamba)
- renamed .html to .tpl (mamba)

<h5>[ To-Do List ]</h5>
<hr>
Adds:
* Definitions and whatnot for creating dynamic playlists.  (i.e. load-balancing like servers, etc.)
* Definitions and whatnot for creating show profiles.  Fairly similar to DJ Profiles.
* Detect and install .htaccess redirect required for using a single set of IceCast counters.
* Real documentation.  There's too much going on in too many text files.  Even more things are undocumented.
* Do something funky w/ the request policy.  Make it more flexible on a group basis. (i.e. site admins have unlimited requests)
* Detect and use UHQ_IceAuth to pass through stream logins in dynamic playlists.

Changes:
* Blocks: Status, change non-AJAX processing to use the AJAX routines to process.
* Module: Add Shoutcast 1.x source integration.  This requires parsing the HTML output, which is going to suck, but is required for SAM integration to work with a Shoutcast source.
* Module: Handoff feature should probably be rewritten.  This does not support multiple channels.
* Module: Find a way to allow anonymous users to make requests. Usually being denied.
* Module: Update admin templates.
* Module: Fix all errors and views w/ a base installation (i.e. no airstaff, mount points, channels, etc.)

Notes:
* IceCast Counter ... needs documentation and repair.
* Sub-menu items don't have a way to determine which channel to use by default, so I'm defaulting this to "1".  I need to figure out how to detect the proper channel if a website ends up hosting more than one station.  I don't know of anyone doing this yet, so it's in the notes bucket.  With this, also make blocks which use a channel be able to autodetect.  This will require multisite in order to take proper advantage of the capability.

<h5>[ Enhancement To-Do List ]</h5>

* Blocks: Coming Up, Allow header, separator, and trailer to have HTML elements in them.
* Blocks: On-Air, allow image width to be settable.
* Module: DJ Test PopUp, Take it from functional to pretty via AJAX.

<h5>0.20   [NOT RELEASED]</h5>
<hr>


<h5>0.14   [NOT RELEASED]</h5>
<hr>
* Module, reporting for TuneIn.com!
* Module, tons of presentation cleanups.  Fresh installs showed a lot of holes.
* Module, submenus are somewhat dynamic.  If there's no integration enabled, most of the menus will not appear.

<h5>0.13   [NOT RELEASED]</h5>
<hr>
Adds:
* Module, new request engine (NRE).  Index page is now a browse by album/browse by artist selection.
* Module, global $uhqradio_request, set to true if both the DJ accepts requests and the user has sufficient permission.
* Module, submenu, added item for song history.  Item count is set in module options.
* Module, submenu, added item for top requests showing all-time and last month.  Item count is set in module options.
* Module option, list length for song history.
* Module option, list length for top request lists.
* Module option, groups allowed to make requests.
* Module, add check for UHQ-IceAuth.  We don't use this yet, but we will.
* Module, FB Plugin, it doesn't really do too much right now, but that will likely change.  There are no docs for it.
* Module, function checks in index.

Changes:
* DB, uhqradio_shistory, added requestor varchar(32) to hold the site username of the requestor.
* Module, fixed all the problems with international characters in artist/album/song fields, or so I think.
* Module, submenu, changed PHP file for DJ Profiles.
* Module, submenu, changed "Playlist" to "Track Search" and renamed the associated PHP file.  NRE is default for finding things now.
* Module, submenu, tracklist, updated list display to use formatted rows.
* Module, pop_request, website username is now being saved to the remote player DB.
* Module, admin, index now template driven!

Notes:
* Anonymous requests are no longer allowed.  I'll look at how to add this capability in, but it's nowhere near a priority.  Lots of false requests have been coming into my own station from crawlers, and they needed to be squashed.
* If you choose to use all the features of this module with a shared hosting provider, you may bump into your provider's resource limitations.  This thing is starting to do a fair amount of work now.
* I am gainfully employed again, so work on this module will now be a bit slower.


<h5>0.12   [2010.12.20]</h5>
<hr>
Adds:
* Blocks, Status, album cover added to the output.  Toggleable option.  (AJAX only)
* Module, index.php, Now displays the top 20 requests of all-time.

Changes:
* Blocks, On-Air, Primarily changed the design to be a side block, limiting the image width to the same as the album art.
* Blocks, Status, cleaned up the formatting on the template side.  Fixed a bug on the php side.  Changed some XML encodings.
* Blocks, Status, changed some declarations in the event of missing data because IE will actually print out "null" when it should be blank.
* Blocks, Upcoming, cleaned up the template.  Returns blank on error, unless reporting is enabled.
* Module, DJ Profile, profile pictures are now stored locally.
* Module, External Cache, added a validation so text updates are only processed from the streaming host, as far as history goes.
* Module, External Cache, diagnostic output is now direct text.  The template engine created a lot of unnecessary overhead.
* Module, Playlist, list length now stored in a cookie.
* Module. Refreshed the module logo with something much more badass.


<h5>0.11   [2010.08.24]</h5>
<hr>

* Module Option: Album URL, base URL for all album art.

Changes:
* Blocks: Coming Up, added block option defaults.
* Blocks: DJ Panel, Removed SAM check for DJs.  Added a "Test Connectivity" link instead.
* Blocks: On-Air, If a DJ is not found in the database, hide block or throw an error based on the module option.
* Blocks: Status, fixed "Display Tune In Link" option.  Now disables graphic if this option is disabled.
* Blocks: Status, updated some of the display logic if a tune-in graphic is not installed.  Minor cleanup.
* Blocks: Upcoming, fixed where the "requested" flag needs to go in the template.
* Module: Corrected a condition where a primary Icecast mountpoint can be detected, but should use the failover mountpoint anyway.

Notes:
* Sorry for missing the last release.  Real life came in and I lost track of time.
* With the exception of the Facebook keys, all the rest of the changes support the initial round of SAM integration.
* It's hard to believe this module has now spent over two years in development.  How time flies!


<h5>0.10   [2010.05.11 NOT RELEASED]</h5>
<hr>
Adds:
* Block: Listener History, displays listener history as a list/graph/blank w/ an optional summary for a specific interval.

* Blocks: Coming Up, options for list header, separator, and trailer.  This can't take HTML at this time.

* Module: Lots of changes to how information is gathered for parts of the module.  Largely to reduce code duplication.
* Module: Moving a bunch of functions around into specific files, lined up by function type.
* Module: djprofile.php, if no profile is specified, return a list of profiles to choose from.  Added page to Radio Submenu.

* Module: index.php, added last 10 songs to radio index.

Notes:
* I'm working on some add-on capabilities, currently developing a FB app.

Adds:
* Blocks: Coming Up, the first fruits of SAM integration which displays which artists are coming up.

* Module Option: SAM Integration, module-wide option to toggle SAM Broadcaster integration and forms.
* Mpdule Option: Stats PW, module-wide option to password-protect the full channel listener count.

Notes:
* The start of SAM Broadcaster integration is here!
* Integration requires an IceCast text mountpoint.  This is because IceCast is the only server which includes the source's IP address in its XML file.
* Sorry about the huge gap in time between updates ... life happens.
